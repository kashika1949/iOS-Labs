## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let Name: String = "John Doe"
print ("We choose to declare Name as a constant because it is a user name that should not change")
var Age : Int = 20
print ("we choose to declare Age as a variable because it is a user age that can change")
var NumberOfStepsTakenToday : Int = 10000
print ("we choose to declare NumberOfStepsTakenToday as a variable because it is a user age that can change")
var GoalNumberOfSteps : Int = 12000
print ("we choose to declare GoalNumberOfSteps as a variable because it is a user age that can change")
var AverageHeartRate : Int = 70
print ("we choose to delcare AverageHeartRate as a variable because it is a user age that can change")

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
